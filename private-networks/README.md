# Private GoChain Deployments

You can deploy GoChain in a private environment for the most optimized, stable 100% Ethereum compatible private blockchain.

## Setting up a Private Network

You can run your own private GoChain network on your own hardware or on a cloud provider.

## On the Cloud

### Microsoft Azure

You can start a network on Azure with just a couple of clicks by choosing GoChain in the Azure Marketplace.

* [Single Node Developer Edition](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/gopath.gochain-single?tab=Overview)
* [Multi-node Enterprise Edition](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/gopath.gochain-multi?tab=Overview)

See [Microsoft's blog announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/gochain-blockchain-launch/).

### AWS

Use our [AWS Cloudformation template](aws/) to get started quickly.

### Your own hardware

See [custom/](custom/) for more information.

## Testing Your Deployment

Once you've deployed, test that it's working by trying the following commands:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"web3_clientVersion","params":[],"id":67}' http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_NODE:8545
```

You should receive something like that:

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":67,"result":"GoChain/v2.1.36/linux-amd64/go1.10.3"}
```
  
3. Ssh into the instance and get an initial allocation address

```
cat genesis.json | grep alloc -C 1
```

You should get few lines, copy one with 40 symbols, then add `0x` to beginning so it looks like this:

```
0x21aca1c055e459808506a37b1a0079723314c18f
```

4. Check that you have something on your initial account via API

```sh
curl http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_NODE:8545  -H 'content-type: application/json;' --data-binary '[{"id":"94455d269e0ee68abf391d9923d26b13","jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance", "params":["ADDRESS_FROM_ABOVE","pending"]}]'
```

You should see initial balance that you set during creation on the Azure site:

```
[{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"94455d269e0ee68abf391d9923d26b13","result":"0xd46b9bd62f3ba7e0"}]
```

5. Get the password of the genesis account (run this on the instance you connected)

```sh
cat password.txt
```

6. Launch the interactive GoChain console on the machine you ssh'd into:

```sh
sudo docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/gochain -w /gochain gcr.io/gochain-core/gochain gochain --datadir /gochain/node attach
```

7. Check the balance of the genesis account

```sh
eth.getBalance('ADDRESS_FROM_ABOVE')
```

8. Go to [GochainWallet](https://wallet.gochain.io/create-account) and create a new account (a public and a private key)

9. Check the balance of the new account in the interactive gochain console 

```sh
eth.getBalance('NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS')
```

10. Unlock the genesis account in the interactive gochain console (the address from the step 3 and the password from the step 5) 

```sh
personal.unlockAccount("ADDRESS_FROM_ABOVE","PASSWORD")
```

11. Transfer some GO from the genesis account to the new one that you created on the step 8
 
```sh
eth.sendTransaction({from:"ADDRESS_FROM_ABOVE",to:'NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',value:1000})
```
 
12. Check the balance of the new account:

```sh
eth.getBalance('NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS')
```

And it should return `1000` in the new account!
