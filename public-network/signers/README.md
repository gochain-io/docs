# Signer Information Sheet

## What is a GoChain Signer?

A GoChain signer is a company/entity that is given the privilege of signing blocks in the GoChain network based on our Proof of Reputation consensus. 

## Whatâ€™s in it for a Signer?

* Publicly supporting the cause of a greener, more decentralized blockchain network
* 7 GO per block signed
* Blocks are signed every 5 seconds
* Even distribution amongst all signers
* ~44M new GO awarded per year
* Early signers earn more due to the network being smaller

## Company Requirements

To get accepted as a GoChain signer, you must meet some minimum requirements. All of these are compared with other nodes in the network to decide if your company would be a good fit. 

* Annual recurring revenue
* Number of employees
* Years in business
* Funding level
* Public/private

## Recommended System Requirements

You'll need a machine with the following specifications or greater:

* 32GB RAM
* CPU - typically, a 32GB machine will have enough CPU to handle it
* SSD drives with at least 200GB of space
* Network - any modern data center/cloud provider should have sufficient network bandwidth

## Testnet QA

Before you will be accepted into the mainnet, you must be able to run a node on our testnet
under heavy load for at least a week. You will be added as a signer to the testnet and a week long
load test will run to ensure you are capable of operating and maintaining your node.

## Ongoing Governance

Every signer must be able to run, manage and operate their server(s) at the following
minimum SLA requirements:

* 3 9's of uptime - 8.76 hours of downtime maximum per year
* 24/7 on call with 2 hour response times (emergency responses should be fairly rare, but availability must be ensured)

If a node cannot keep up with these requirements, they may be immediately voted out.

If a signer must be removed for other reasons, such as a more reputable company coming online, there
will be 60 day notice before being voted out. Signers must also give 60 days before voluntarily leaving.
