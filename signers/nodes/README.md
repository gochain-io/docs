# For Authorized Signers

## Running a Node

### Prerequisites

* Docker > 18.0 ([lnk](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
* Docker-compose ([link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

### Initial Configuration

1. Put your password in password.txt in same folder with docker-compose.yml
2. Create an account for reward activities.

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/root gochain/gochain gochain --datadir /root/node --password /root/password.txt account new
```

3. Backup the `node/keystore` directory you just created! If you lose it, you will lose all of your rewards!
4. Copy example.env to .env file (make it default for docker-compose)
5. Update example.env (replace ACCOUNT_YOU_GOT_ON_STEP_1 with account_id you got on step 1)
6. Update app.json (replace YOUR_SECRET with secret that you got from gochain team and YOUR_NODE_NAME with name of your company)
7. Launch docker-compose

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

8. Make sure that node works

```sh
docker logs -f node
```

9. Reach gochain team with account_id to add you into the list of signers
